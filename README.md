# FDCache
A simle cache manager class reference to the SDImageCache in SDWebImage.

Basing on the file system, my class reads and writes into cache data through the key corresponding to the file.

The problems lay in inconvenient extension, lacking of metadata, unavailiableness of the elimination algorithm, slowness to statistics.

keey it simple and tiny.
